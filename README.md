# Stock Price CPM Shiny App

A change point is an instance in time where the statistical properties before and after the point differ. A Change Point Analysis is an effective tool in creating an alert for stock price changes.

The Change Point Model (CPM) is based on the <code>cpm</code> package in R which implements various change point models for sequential change detection, using both parametric and nonparametric methods.
